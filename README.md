# Large-scale ligand-based virtual screening for potential SARS-Cov-2 inhibitors using a deep neural network
Due to the current severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic,there is an urgent need for novel therapies anddrugs. We conducted a large-scale virtual screening for small molecules that are potential CoV-2 inhibitors. To this end, we use a deep neural network, called ”ChemAI”, trained on more than220M data points over 3.6M molecules from three public drug-discovery databases. This network is used to screen and rank a billion molecules from the ZINC database for favourable effects againstCoV-2. We publish the 50,000 top-ranked compounds, which are easily accessible via ZINC, as a library for further screening with bioassays.
